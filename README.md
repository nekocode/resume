This is a repo to host the source files of my personal resume. You can build it locally using `make` command. You can see the generated pdf file [here](http://nekocode.cn/resume.pdf).

Special thanks to [Sourabh Bajaj](https://github.com/sb2nov) for his [template](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume). This project makes some modifications base on it.
